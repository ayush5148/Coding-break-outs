====Short: //Amazon Pay EU CS Associates can not file A-Z Claims on behalf of the buyer.//====
**Ticket Severity:** 2.00000000
**Escalation Time:** 2020-02-05 15:42:09
**Create Date:** 2020-01-03 07:25:36
====Key Call-outs====

**Note:** Call-outs like **No customer impact** or **False Alarm** can be helpful, but always also add a bullet about how you are preventing similar issues from randomizing CAPS and SDEs in the future. This might be as simple as **Fixed the alarm** or **Updated the SOP**.
* **Is this cut manually?**, //&lt;Please provide a reason why this wasn't an auto-cut.&gt;//
* **Is this a recurring issue?** //&lt;Please provide a reason why you believe this ticket won't recur&gt;//
====Summary====
* **//Customer Impact : //**
**Who are your customers?:** //&lt;Identify the end customers of your application and start with them&gt;//
**What does this ticket mean to them?:** //&lt;Put yourself in the shoes of your customers. What does this ticket mean to your customers? Are they impaired of using some functionality? Did we compromise on their trust? Is their productivity impacted?&gt;//
**What are the marketplaces impacted?:** //&lt;Please mention all the affected marketplaces&gt;//
**How many customers are impacted?:** //&lt;Ex: 250 customers in NA and EU&gt;//
**How long are they impacted?:** //&lt;Mention the duration of impact&gt;//
* **//Underlying Cause : //**
The entire HealBeam service had an outage just a day prior: https://tt.amazon.com/0423626885 due to which A-Z claims was impacted company wide. Need customer screenshots for further root cause.
====Resolution====
PAS is working as expected, need to verify on YAUI FrontEnd why the dropdown is not appearing for buyer. Since we cannot see buyer's YAUI view need you to get back with more information.
====Prevention====
* **How could this have been prevented?**
* **Do you have any existing backlog item that would&amp;rsquo;ve prevented or greatly reduced impact of this event?:** If yes, why was this not completed prior to the event?:
* **Can this issue affect other applications owned by your team or teams around you?:** Ex: ServiceFoo also depends on buggy version of LibXYZ. We can apply the same resolution to prevent this issue from affecting ServiceFoo
====Action Items====
* **Note:** If this high-sev is due to a code bug, consider action items to add integration tests.
